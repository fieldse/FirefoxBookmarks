A simple python module to list the Firefox bookmarks on the 
commandline and let user choose. Opens selected in browser. 

You can set this up to a hotkey:
Save file to your /usr/local/bin directory as 'bookmarks.py'
> chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bookmarks.py

Add a keyboard shortcut under Ubuntu Settings -> Keyboard:

Title: Firefox Bookmarks

Command: ```gnome-terminal -x bookmarks.py```

Change keyboard shortcut to your preference. (Super+B works)

Voila. Terminal Firefox bookmarks menu
